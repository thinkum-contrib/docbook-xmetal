XMetal DocBook support files
-------------------------------

This directory contains a sample of 
the support files needed to write and
edit DocBook XML files in SoftQuad's
XMetal editor.  Copy these files to
the Rules directory under your installed
XMetal directory.  When you start a new
XML document, you can select 'docbook412.rlx'
and all these files will be used.

 docbook412.css    - cascading stylesheet for screen display
 docbook412.ctm    - rules for handling xml in editor
 docbook412.rlx    - compiled DocBook XML 4.1.2 DTD
 docbook412.tbr    - another support file

These are contrib files and carry no guarantee.
They are meant as a sample starting point for
using DocBook XML in  XMetal.  Adapt them for
your own needs.  See the COPYRIGHT file
for the legal notice associated with these files.

Feedback welcome.
